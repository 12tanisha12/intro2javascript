<p>Today I learned about how to change color of many diffrent ids by clicking a button by using javascript to program it to happen. The first tag we learned is button to make a button. The second tag I learned is the function tag that is used to make that action work and in that you add a id to name all the buttons to assign an action to each button. Through this way you add "getElementById" for the computer to understand that inorder to assign a task to each command, to look for its speffic id. I also learned that you have to add () to the id inorder for it to orde along with curly brackets.</p>
  <button onclick="font()">change font</button>
